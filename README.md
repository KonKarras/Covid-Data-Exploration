# Covid Data Exploration

Exploration project conducted on data provided through the following link: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

After downloading the original .csv file, containing all data from 1-1-2020 onwards, we split it into two .xlsx files; 

the Covid Deaths and the Covid Vaccinations, which we later import into SSMS to create the two tables we will be working with.

The actual exploration takes place across 13 different SQL queries:

1) Covid Deaths dataset's check,

2) Covid Vaccinations dataset's check,

3) Selecting possibly interesting columns,

4) Total Deaths vs Total Cases,

5) Total Cases vs Population,

6) Highest Infection Rate per Country,

7) Highest Death Count per Country,

8) Highest Death Count per Continent,

9) Global Numbers,

10) Vaccinations vs Population,

11) CTE (Common Table Expression) on previous query,

12) Temp(orary) Table on previous query and

13) View on previous query.

In a future update, some of those queries will give interesting visualizations on Tableau, resulting in valuable insights.
